  'Today in what is often termed the "mind body spirit" or "New Age" movement it is taken for granted that spiritual healing is a skill which can be taught and learnt. All conditions can be treated by spiritual healing - but not all people. Some people are more receptive than others to this treatment, due to a number of factors such as karma and mental outlook. As such the results of healing can vary a great deal. If the patient has faith in the technique and the healer, this will of course aid the healing process, but is not necessary; this is not faith healing as practiced in some religions - it is based instead on spiritual energy. This being the case, it is possible for a skeptic to receive healing and benefit from it. Spiritual healing can help people in many different ways - sometimes unexpected. Healing may completely cure someone - or may not, but may instead help them to deal with the condition they have and to become more positive. It is extremely rare for someone to receive healing and then report no improvement afterwards whatsoever, and indeed many people report that they feel a great deal better, often where other treatments have failed. Miraculous instantaneous cures are rare - but not unknown, and we should always be open to this possibility. As well as benefiting others, the more spiritual healing we give, the more we will develop spiritually - and psychically (In the process we heal ourselves). And the more we develop spiritually and psychically, the better healers we will become.';

export const summaryHome2 =
  'Spirituality can be seen as being distinct from religion. Different world religions have proposed various doctrines and belief systems about the nature of a God and humanity\'s relationship with it. Spirituality, on the other hand, refers to the common experience behind these various points of view. It is an experience involving an awareness of and relationship with something that transcends your personal self as well as the human order of things. This "something" has been given various names ("God" being the most popular in Western Society) and defined in ways that are too numerous to count. We call it simply as the God. You can choose to define what that means for yourself in whatever way feels most appropriate. Your own sense of a God can be as abstract as "cosmic consciousness" or as down-to-earth as the beauty of the ocean or mountains. Even if you regard yourself an agnostic or atheist, you may get a sense of inspiration from taking a walk in the forest or contemplating a beautiful sunset. Or a small child\'s smile may give you a special sense of joy.';
export const titleAbout1 = "OUR PHILOSOPHY";
export const summaryAbout1 =
  "We acknowledge that anything is possible in healing. The body is a marvelous self-healing mechanism, and we often underestimate the ability of the body and the human spirit to recover from illness and trauma. At the same time, we emphasize the difference between curing and healing, affirming that while curing does not always occur, healing is always possible. We support the broadest possible definition of healing to become Whole, acknowledging that the experience of Wholeness is available regardless of any situation or circumstance. Above all, we feel that while the pairs of opposites are always present in life pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow, darkness and light it is nevertheless possible to experience inner peace. This is possible through an expansion of awareness which allows us to embrace a larger perspective and discover more refined qualities of love, compassion, gratitude and joy which lie beyond surface appearances. When it comes to matters related to healing and spirituality, we are all involved in a journey of learning. When we learn something with someone, we may call them a teacher, but in reality, everyones understanding and experience is unique. We are all self authenticating even when we decide something based on an authority, it is ultimately our judgment about that person being an authority and we make the decision to honor the perspective or information received from them. We encourage everyone to believe in themselves and what rings true for them. We hope to encourage freedom of exploration and expression, as well as trust in oneself and the larger Life of which we are all a part. There are a myriad of viewpoints, as many as there are people. As ones perspective becomes broader and one grows in wisdom, tolerance and compassion, it becomes clear that no one viewpoint is correct. The best test of the rightness of a belief is whether it serves you and supports you in having a fulfilled life.";

In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain. Hypnosis can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis.",

It can shorten the delivery stage of labour and reduce the need for painkillers. It can ease the suffering of the disabled and those facing terminal illness, and it has been shown to help people to overcome addictions such as smoking and alcoholism, and to help with bulimia.

Conditions exacerbated by tension, such as irritable bowel syndrome, psoriasis and eczema, and excessive sweating, respond well, and even tinnitus and clicky jaws (tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction) can be treated by these techniques.",
          "Hypnotherapy has been used to stop self-destructive and addictive habits like smoking. It has also been used to curb the urge to eat for overeaters, to stem the disruptive actions of tics, cure insomnia , stop bed-wetting, and minimize anxiety. Excessive stress can be generated from any number of sources and can be the springboard for anxiety. Some of the more prominent sources of anxiety and stress for which people seek hypnotherapy are: public speaking, test taking, and job stress. Hypnotherapy also works well for other anxiety disorders such as phobias and has proven to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression. In one study, hypnotherapy was used in conjunction with traditional cognitive therapy, to assist persons who had severe aversion to needles. The treatment was necessary, because it was essential that each participant receive periodic medical injections. However, the participants would have become non-compliant without the adjunct intervention of hypnotherapy. In another case, involving care for terminally ill cancer patients, it was concluded that hypnotherapy was more effective at enhancing quality of life and relieving anxiety and depressive symptoms, when compared to others who received traditional care.",

In acupuncture, the Chinese refer to this subtle energy as Chi. It is also called Ruach or the Breath of Life in Hebrew.",
          'Pranic Healing is a simple yet powerful and effective system of no touch energy healing. It is based on the fundamental principles that the body is a self-repairing living entity that possesses the ability to heal itself and that the healing process is accelerated by increasing this life force that is readily available from the sun, air and ground to address physical & emotional imbalances. Master Choa Kok Sui says "Life Energy or prana is all around us. It is pervasive we are actually in an ocean of Life Energy. Based on this principle, a healer can draw in Pranic Energy or Life Energy from the surroundings."',
          "Pranic Healing requires no drugs, gadgets, not even physical contact with the subject. Physical contact is not required because the practitioner is working on the bioplasmic or energy body and not directly on the physical body. This energy body, or aura, is the mold or blueprint that surrounds and interpenetrates the physical body. It is the energy body that absorbs life energy and distributes it throughout the physical body, to the muscles, organs, glands, etc. The reason Pranic Healing works on the energy body is that physical ailments first appear as energetic disruptions in the aura before manifesting as problems in the physical body.",
          'This pervasive energy that surrounds, interpenetrates and sustains the physical body, also affects our emotions, our ability to handle stress, relationships and even finances. "In Ancient times, Pranic Healing could only be practiced by an elite few. My job was to develop a very effective healing system, which ordinary people could learn in just a short period. Anybody can practice pranic healing now. The knowledge of being able to deal with simple ailments is quite empowering."- Master Choa Kok Sui',

If one is life force energy is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy. The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words Rei which means God is Wisdom or the Higher Power and Ki which is life force energy. So Reiki is actually spiritually guided life force energy.",

In fact, Reiki is not dependent on belief at all and will work whether you believe in it or not. Because Reiki comes from God, many people find that using Reiki puts them more in touch with the experience of their religion rather than having only an intellectual concept of it. While Reiki is not a religion, it is still important to live and act in a way that promotes harmony with others. Mikao Usui, the founder of the Reiki system of natural healing, recommended that one practice certain simple ethical ideals to promote peace and harmony, which are nearly universal across all cultures.",
          "During a meditation several years after developing Reiki, Mikao Usui decided to add the Reiki Ideals to the practice of Reiki. The Ideals came in part from the five principles of the Meiji emperor of Japan whom Mikao Usui admired. The Ideals were developed to add spiritual balance to Usui Reiki. Their purpose is to help people realize that healing the spirit by consciously deciding to improve oneself is a necessary part of the Reiki healing experience. In order for the Reiki healing energies to have lasting results, the client must accept responsibility for her or his healing and take an active part in it. Therefore, the Usui system of Reiki is more than the use of the Reiki energy. It must also include an active commitment to improve oneself in order for it to be a complete system. The ideals are both guidelines for living a gracious life and virtues worthy of practice for their inherent value.",
